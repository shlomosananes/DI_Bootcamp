# datetime is a built-in Module
# what comes after the from is the module
# what comes after the import is the class
# there is a module named datetime and a class named datetime.
# According to python guidelines in PEP 8, the class should be named Datetime
# If we write only 'import datetime' we will import the whole Module
# In this case, when calling the classe 'datetime' we must write datetime.datetime_____
# We can use 'alias' to avoid confusion

Instructions
Create a function that displays the amount of time left from now until January 1st.

"""

# import datetime

# Date Output
# When we execute the code from the example above the result will be:

# The date contains year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond.
#
# The datetime module has many methods to return information about the date object.
#
# Here are a few examples, you will learn more about them later in this chapter:
# Return

# of
# weekday:

# print(x.year)
# print(x.strftime("%A"))

# CREATING DATE OBJECTS
# To create a date, we can use the datetime() class (constructor) of the datetime module.
#
# The datetime() class requires three parameters to create a date: year, month, day.
